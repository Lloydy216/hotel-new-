Hailey’s Hotel has been a cornerstone of its local community for nearly five decades. However, its reliance on pen-and-paper record keeping has introduced inefficiencies, from lost bookings to miscommunicated messages.

This project delivers a modern, front-end web interface tailored for Hailey’s Hotel, introducing a seamless, branded online booking experience. Guests can search for accommodations and make reservations with ease, bringing the hotel’s digital presence in line with contemporary expectations.
