Hailey’s Hotel has been a cornerstone of its local community for nearly five decades. However, its reliance on pen-and-paper record keeping has introduced inefficiencies, from lost bookings to miscommunicated messages.

This project delivers a modern, front-end web interface tailored for Hailey’s Hotel, introducing a seamless, branded online booking experience. Guests can search for accommodations and make reservations with ease, bringing the hotel’s digital presence in line with contemporary expectations.

 Project Pages
index.html – Main landing page for Hailey’s Hotel

booking.html – Interactive booking form

booking-confirmation.html – Displays booking details

payment-confirmation.html – Confirms successful payment

Formspree also used in the contact and room booking pages.
Formspree ensures smooth, seamless form handling, and provides the benefit of no backend infrastructure while maintaining secure data handling for basic form submissions.
Anti-Spam Honeypot - To help protect the forms from automated spam submissions, an anti-spam honeypot field has been included in both the Contact Us and Book a Room forms.
